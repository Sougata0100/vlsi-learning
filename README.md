# VLSI Learning – Sougata

I am an Electronics and Communication Engineering graduate learning **VLSI design** from scratch.  
This repository shows my small Verilog projects as I prepare for VLSI / semiconductor jobs worldwide.

## Project 1 – LED Blinker (Verilog)

- Design: Simple LED blinker using a counter and a flip-flop.
- Testbench: Generates a clock and prints the LED value over time.
- Goal: Understand `always @(posedge clk)`, counters, and `reg` vs `wire`.

I ran the design on EDA Playground and captured the simulation log/screenshot.

## Project 2 – Basic C Programs

- **loop_counter.c**: Program using a `while` loop to print numbers 1-10
  - Demonstrates: Loop iteration, increment operators, and printf formatting
  
- **sum_calculator.c**: Program using a `for` loop to calculate the sum of numbers 1-100
  - Demonstrates: For loop syntax, accumulation, and mathematical operations
  
- **largest_number.c**: Program using conditional logic (if-else) to find the largest of three numbers
  - Demonstrates: User input with scanf(), conditional statements, and logical operators (&&)

These basic C programs reinforce fundamental programming concepts essential for embedded systems and VLSI applications.
