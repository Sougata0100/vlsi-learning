# VLSI Learning – Sougata

I am an Electronics and Communication Engineering graduate learning **VLSI design** from scratch.  
This repository shows my small Verilog projects as I prepare for VLSI / semiconductor jobs worldwide.

## Project 1 – LED Blinker (Verilog)

- Design: Simple LED blinker using a counter and a flip-flop.
- Testbench: Generates a clock and prints the LED value over time.
- Goal: Understand `always @(posedge clk)`, counters, and `reg` vs `wire`.

I ran the design on EDA Playground and captured the simulation log/screenshot.
